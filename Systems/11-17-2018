Named pipe
mkfifo wario does cool thing -> makes named pipe
doesn't store any data, only transfers
cat wario
cat > wario --> none live streaming of pipe
as soon as you close all readers, the write doesn't do anything and ends
named pipes can be deleted and still work

Named Pipes
Also known as FIFOs.
Same as unnamed pipes.
Do `mkfifo <name>`

mkfifo - <sys/types.h> <sys/stat.h>
C function to create a FIFO
Returns 0 on sucess and -1 on failure

Once open, works like normal file

FIFOs will block on open until both sides have a connection

mkfifo( name, permissions )

WARNING:
Read/Write opens both ends of the pipe simultaniously and closes the pipe.
