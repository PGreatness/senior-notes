Consider a program that uses pipes in order to communicate between 2 
seperate executable files. One file is a "server" that is always running.
The other is a "client"

Handshake
A procedure to ensure that a connection has been established between 2 programs.
Both ends of the connection must verify that they can send and receive 
data to and from each other. 

3 way handshake
	Client sends a message to the server.
	Server sends a response to the client.
	Client sends a response back to server.

Basic server/client design pattern
1. Setup
	1.1 Server creates a FIFO (Well Known Pipe) and waits for a connection.
	1.2 Client creates a "private" FIFO.
2. Handshake
	2.1 Client connects to server and sends the private FIFO name. Client
	    waits for a response from the server.
	2.2 Server receives client's message and removes the WKP.
	2.3 Server connects to client FIFO, sending an initial acknowledgement
	    message.
	2.4 Client receives server's message, removes its private FIFO.
	2.5 Client sends response to server.
3. Operation
	Server and client send info back and forth.
4. Reset
	4.1 Client exits, server closes any connection to the client.
	4.2 Server recreates the WKP and waits for another client.
