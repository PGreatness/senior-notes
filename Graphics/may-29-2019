Shading
=======
* How frequently we calculate the color (I)

Flat Shading (current model)
----------------------------
* Calculate I once per polygon

Gouraud Shading
---------------
(( Looks slightly like clay in a dimly lit room, kinda runny ))
* Looks at 3 different vectors, we'll talk about how to get them later
* It looks at the vertex normal
* Calculate the color at each vertex
1. Calculate a normal for each vertex
2. Calculate I for each vertex
3. Interpolate I while drawing scanlines
		^ I_T
	       / \
	 I_1  /...\ I_0
	     /     \
        I_M  ------- I_B

Phong Shading
-------------
(( Very realistic, but looks like everything is wet ))

* Calculate a normal for each vertex
* Interpolate the normal while drawing scanlines
* Calculate I once per pexel with the interpolated pixel
